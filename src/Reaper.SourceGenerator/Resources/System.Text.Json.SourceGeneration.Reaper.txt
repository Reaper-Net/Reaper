This is a minor modification to the .NET 8 internal Source Generator.

The modification is on our fork of the runtime and available in the following commit:
https://github.com/Reaper-Net/runtime/commit/2cfce418262a152ba7b13dccf9939f4484d75503

The changes are specifically:
- The namespace is changed to remove conflicts. In testing, the .NET 8 Source Generator is loaded internally if it 
  doesn't match so this is a requisite.
- All of the internal private classes were made public, so we can construct what we need to.
- ReportDiagnosticsAndEmitSource was made public so we can use it directly.

It's the only way to allow us to virtually chain the generators. If we don't, it doesn't generate the context.

You can see a discussion on this nonsense here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/discussions/48358

If the situation changes in the future, of course this will be updated / removed.
