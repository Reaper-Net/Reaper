This is a minor modification to the .NET 8 internal Source Generator.

Specifically:
- The namespace is changed, to remove conflicts. In testing, the .NET 8 Source Generator is loaded internally if it 
  doesn't match so this is a requisite.
- All of the internal private classes were made public, so we can construct what we need to.
- A helper method was added, though it's currently not used.

Note that this does *NOT* emit diagnostic information, it might do in the future.

It's the only way to allow us to virtually chain the generators. If we don't, it doesn't generate the context.

You can see a discussion on this nonsense here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/discussions/48358

If the situation changes in the future, of course this will be updated.
